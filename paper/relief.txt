Personal Thought (Policies that could be implemented):-
1) Educating people, with correct scientific local information would accelerate the general cluster community for faster recovery. (For India - Digital India initiative, For U.S. Daily briefing by governer and their Medical committee)

2) All country should implement forces in their power. So, no lower force is overwhelmed by the duty. 
E.g. Use Military/ Army to control lockdown if Police is overwhelmed. Or free the police, So that they can help 
distribute food and relief wherever required as they are more close to locals and do jobs in a much more disciplined/ 
meanwhile, let the Military/ Army have a control the lockdown. 

(People in uniform and boots tend to follow orders in a much more structured manner than the one who are not.) 
Voluntary Cadet and Volunteers can be given temporary positions for controlling the crowd and informing the crowd with correct information 
about the current status. local volunteers can help with resources like building containment centres and moving necessary food and medicine. 
A cluster to be generally accompanied with a volunteer(Preferably a state cadet. Every school/ college(These are students after 10+2)
(governs 2 k.m. radius of the population) has 30 odd senior cadet(India) = scouts(U.S)) -> Havaldar =
private(https://www.military.com/army/enlisted-ranks.html), who reports back to local law enforcement (Governor or Ranking officer equivalent). 

(1) and (2) are basically to follow the hierarchical(chain of command) model to solve the problem. 

Homeless/ Migrants, be given a proper place at a temporary shelter and food by following rules as per social distancing. 
e.g. :- https://laist.com/2020/03/13/los-angeles-homeless-coronaviurs-covid.php

3) Vaccine preparation and Testing should be free. As an unhealthy/ mortally dead individual makes zero contribution to the future of 
any country (Reality Check for leaders). 

4) A casualty of any essential working individual should not be taken lightly. 

5) We are in this together we would be only judged by the humanity and kindness we show during such times, and the way we can overcome such a pandemic of this scale. 

6) Techies/ Companies mass-producing medical equipment should have access to any and every resource available in the community/ 
should report to local law enforcement.

7) Doctors should be given special powers the right of refusal to treat COVID patients in absence of proper PPE. As the doctor per patient ratio is less than 1. 
(Consent based treatment) 

8) Trains/ metro can be used for the transfer of local amenities like food and medical supplies as they have lifts and such functions to be only operated by law enforcement bodies. (Trains and Metros are available in all major/ minor cities and are well connected to a 6 k.m. 
radius population.) People can post there the necessary inventory availability of supplies on government sites and requests.

9) All information from (1) to (8) can be dispersed using the COVID tracker app using (APP without borders[Taken from doctors w/o borders]/ one-stop solution)/ general news (E.g. Daily Briefing already done by N.Y Gov Cuomo for U.S/ For India, My Gov App or Linkedin page and Mann ki baat/ Good news source like WEF/ UN News/ WHO briefing on Facebook).

10) Russia resorts to surveillance for checking on proper followup of lockdown. (Not my personal favourite, just an opinion)
(source:- https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/cybergulag-russia-looks-to-surveillance-technology-to-enforce-lockdown)

11) Technology should be used properly with accessibility to resource and following Ethics and Privacy-Preserving guidelines. 
On top level not harming any citizen of any community. (GDPR)

12) SmartTech should be a solution and not a curse, and to be promoted to use wisely as advised by the Research community. (Of course, no one wants to touch that doorbell at times like this. Intercom are the perfect solution to such a problem.) 

13) People working as part of the essential worker category who are in constant touch with other people should take extra precautions.

14) Intercity trains/ subways can be good transportation of transfer essential commodities like food/ medicine/ essential workers and other 
essential things as per their daily schedule. 
E.g. 
         1) New York could use the SubWay to do the above thingy.
         2) Mumbai has BMC bus running to transport essential workers.
         3) Delhi could use the metro's as all metro station cover 2k.m. radius of the general population. + CRPF security(Central Reserve Police Force).
         
15) The crime rates may go down, but domestic violence can go up. Victims of such events should be given sanctuary at proper places, local authorities should be cognizant of such matters. (Source:- NYPD crime stats, todo for me to add source link.)
