Personal Thought (Policy ):-
a) Educating people, with correct scientific local information would accelerate the general cluster community for faster 
recovery. 
b) All country should implement forces in there power. So, no lower force is overwhelmed by the duty. 
For e.g. Use Military/ Army to control lockdown if Police is overwhelmed. Or free the police, So that they can help 
distribute food and relief where required as they are more close to locals and do jobs in a much more disciplined/ 
and let Military/ Amry to control the lockdown. (People in uniform and boots have tendency to follow orders in a much more 
structured manner then the one who are not.) Voluntary Cadet and Volunteers can be given temporary positions for controling 
crowd and informing the crowd about current status. local volunteers can help with resources like building containment 
centers and moving necessary food and medicine. A cluster to be generally accompanied with a volunteer/ private, who reports 
back to local law enforcement. 

Homeless/ Migrants, be given a proper place at temporary shelter and food inaccordance with social distancing. e.g. :- https://laist.com/2020/03/13/los-angeles-homeless-coronaviurs-covid.php
c) Vaccine preparation and Testing should be free. As a unhealthy/ mortal individual makes zero contribution to future of 
any country (Reality Check for leaders). 
d) Casuality of any essential working individual should not be taken lightly. 
e) We are in this together we would be only judged by the humanity and kindness we show durign such times, and the brutal way 
we can overcome such a pandemic of this scale. 
f) Techies/ Companies mass producing medical equipments should have access to any and every resource available in the 
community/ should report to local law enforcement.
g) Doctors should be given special powers the right of refusal to treat Covid patients in absence of proper PPE. 
(Consent based treatment) 
h) trains/ metro can be used for transfer of local amenities like food and medical supplies as they have lifts and to be operated 
by only law enforcement bodies. (Trains and Metros are available in all major/ minor cities and are well conneced to a 6 k.m. 
radius population.) People can post their the necessary inventory availabilty of supplies on government sites. 
i) All information from a) to h) can be dispered using the covid tracker app/ general news. 
j) Russia resorts to surveilance for checking on proper followup of lockdown. 
k) Technology should be used properly with accessibility to resource.
