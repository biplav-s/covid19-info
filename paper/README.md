## Mortality in N.Y. ***Updated***
1. The number of deaths in N.Y. has crossed then the one in 9/11 - Article Source from Facebook feed True New Yorker Prof. Yann LeCun

A suggestive formula for testing folks and local patrol distribution for care and compliance of lockdown (human resources/medical personal).

***[essential_supplies, essential_personal] = f(covid_population_density)***

#### Description:- 

###### output variables:-
> a) essential_supplies(vector):- essential supplies include but is not limited to testing supplies, food distribution and services.
> b) essential_personal(vector):- essential personal include patrol police men, doctors, nurses and skeletal crew to keep the system running.

###### Function f is the model, on which one wants to train the data.

###### input variables:-
> a) covid_population_density:- It is the population density of a given location with covid patients in the location being vectors.

***Q:Why covid is treated as vectors? A:- Covid spread airborne and is invisible. The time the Covid patient realizes he is Covid +ve. he has already infected others.***

For e.g. To control vectors if New York (10 k.m. scale) has to go into complete lockdown it has to use minimum patrol force as many location manhattan, brooklyn and staten island are surrounded by water. If Delhi(10 k.m. scale) has to go into lockdown it has to cover a generic parameter like a circle of sorts. While for mumbai (5 k.m. scale) it will be much less then either for city-wide lockdown. *(Geographic reference's are made using Google Maps)*
Also here, complete lockdown here is deploying patrol forces at city borders. Please find below snapshots of maps.

## Weather
### United States:-
1. High Temperature should help in reduction of the number of cases. The gif shows the Max Temperature for U.S. [March 18-31, 2020]. Check animation of weather report here. ![](https://github.com/biplav-s/covid19-info/blob/b6f98ae4928a76d197b74c042045aa4217972766/paper/Max_Temp_in_US_From_18th_to31.gif)

2. Air quality index has improved in many parts. This should help in faster recovery. Please, Find below snapshot prepared from AQI site for date [March 28, 2020].![](https://github.com/biplav-s/covid19-info/blob/b6f98ae4928a76d197b74c042045aa4217972766/paper/aqi%202020-03-28%2019-57-09.png) and here is the link to the [Main website of aqicn.org](https://aqicn.org/city/usa/new-york/holtsville/)

## Non-Drug Theraphy. (Disclaimer:- Me #NotAMedicalDoctor)
>* Non-Drug Theraphy apart from the already mentioned drug related theraphy[Knowledge Graph of COVID-19 Literature - IBM](https://ds-covid19.res.ibm.com/reports/drugs) [Source: WEF Christina Soares, Medical Editor Reuters.](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/drugs-vaccines-therapies-covid19-health?fbclid=IwAR0cXgcBoUiSFQW7KD_Sp1fDzG2XElK8TRikt4MoiauFjrEm8PXiXaIqN00)

## Policies that could be useful on implementation. 

1. Educating people, with correct scientific local information would accelerate the general cluster community for faster recovery. 
>*  For India - Digital India initiative/ MyGov App/ PMO App/ Aarogya Setu, 
>*  For U.S. Daily briefing by governer/ President and their importantly their Medical committee.

2. Hierarchical Model:- All country should implement forces in their power. So, no lower force is overwhelmed by the duty. 
>* For E.g. Use Military/ Army to control lockdown if Police is overwhelmed by the lockdown activies. Or free the police, So that they can help distribute food and relief wherever required as they are more close to locals and they do their jobs in a much more disciplined way. Meanwhile let the Military/ Army have a control the lockdown. 
***(People in uniform and boots tend to follow orders in a much more structured manner than the one who are not.Voluntary Cadet and Volunteers can be given temporary positions for directing the crowd and informing the crowd with correct information about the current status. local volunteers can help with resources like building containment centres and moving necessary food and medicine. A cluster to be generally accompanied with a volunteer (Preferably a state cadet in uniform. Every school/ college(These are students after 10+2) (governs 2 k.m. radius of the population) has 30 odd senior cadet(India) = scouts(U.S)) -> Havaldar =private (https://www.military.com/army/enlisted-ranks.html), who reports back to local law enforcement (Governor or Ranking officer equivalent).)***

*(1) and (2) are basically to follow the Hierarchical (chain of command) model to solve the problem.*

3. Homeless/ Migrants, be given a proper place at a temporary shelter and food by following rules as per social distancing. There can also be multiple foodbanks to keep up with their needs. Foodbanks can have multiple telephone numbers like- 1800-STD-FOOD (3663). Here STD can be area telephone code for delhi(011), mumbai(022) etc. (This is only an idea. Countries and their respective states can do whatever they can do best for the same. This information should be available on multiple places like the website of Ministry/ Dept of Health or the contact tracing App)
[Example of Los Angeles Homeless coronavirus care.](https://laist.com/2020/03/13/los-angeles-homeless-coronaviurs-covid.php)
[March 13, 2020]

4. Vaccine preparation and Testing should be free. As an unhealthy/ mortally dead individual makes zero contribution to the future of any country (Reality Check for leaders). 

5. A casualty of any essential working individual should not be taken lightly. 

6. We are in this together we would be only judged by the humanity and kindness we show during such times, and the way we can overcome such a pandemic of this scale. 

7. Techies/ Companies mass-producing medical equipment should have access to any and every resource available in the community/ should report to local law enforcement. 

8. Doctors should be given special powers the right of refusal to treat COVID patients in absence of proper PPE. As the doctor per patient ratio is less than 1. [Consent based treatment. #RealityCheckForEveryOne]() 

9. Trains/ metro can be used for the transfer of local amenities like food and medical supplies as they have lifts and such functions to be only operated by law enforcement bodies. (Trains and Metros are available in all major/ minor cities and are well connected to a 6 k.m. radius population.) People can post there the necessary inventory availability of supplies on government sites and requests.

10. All information from point (1) to (8) can be dispersed using the COVID tracker app using (APP without borders[Taken from doctors w/o borders]/ one-stop solution)/ general news (E.g. Daily Briefing already done by N.Y Gov Cuomo for U.S/ For India, My Gov App or Linkedin page and Mann ki baat/ Good news source like WEF/ UN News/ WHO briefing on Facebook).

11. Russia resorts to surveillance for checking on proper followup of lockdown. (Not my personal favourite, just an opinion. But the country is doing something to keep its citizen safe, though more of a desperate measure. Better then many others. "July situation for India is already now in Russia.") 
[Guardian talks about surveilance technology enforcement](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/cybergulag-russia-looks-to-surveillance-technology-to-enforce-lockdown)[April 2, 2020] ***Updated***

12. Technology should be used properly with accessibility to resource and following Ethics and Privacy-Preserving guidelines. On top level not harming any citizen of any community. (GDPR)

13. SmartTech should be a solution and not a curse, and to be promoted to use wisely as advised by the Research community. (Of course, no one wants to touch that doorbell at times like this. Intercom are the perfect solution to such a problem.) 

14. People working as part of the essential worker category who are in constant touch with other people should take extra precautions. Let's just say with facemask, they can add face shield. I compiled a list of sources for the same. Source:- Madhavan's FB feed.
>* MIT initiates mass manufacture of disposable face shields for COVID-19 response. [Please, find the source by MIT here](http://news.mit.edu/2020/face-shield-ppe-manufacture-covid-19-0331?fbclid=IwAR306h7WkwRxkXxSi7S18r9Qh94uCPyM_PCQrzlADfwue8gtNg8COl7KdxE)[March 31, 2020]

--- They should make use of face shield for literals and raincoats (why raincoats zero penetration then cotton clothes. fast cleaning. Everyone has it atleast in India. So in N.Y. Little Indian solution to the community/ Macgyver solutions.).

14. Intercity trains/ subways can be good transportation of transfer essential commodities like food/ medicine/ essential workers and other essential things as per their daily schedule. 
For Example
>* New York could use the SubWay to do the above thingy.
>* Mumbai has been already using BMC bus to transport essential workers.
>* Delhi could use the metro's as all metro station cover 2- 6k.m. radius of the general population. + CRPF security(Central Reserve Police Force).
         
15. The crime rates may go down, but domestic violence can go up. Victims of such events should be given sanctuary at proper places, local authorities should be cognizant of such matters. [This is from NYPD crime stats, At the press briefing - Add link todo]

16. Why India has the upper hand against COVID-19 [Please, find the published article by World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/india-covid19-coronavirus-response-kerala-uttar-pradesh/)[April 17,2020]

19. with less than 10 days before the first monsoon arrives after the pandemic announcement(coronavirus can stay in the atmosphere for a long time). 
>* Everyone should be prepared now more than ever. Like every general household should get a thermometer for a general temperature check. I know the contactless thermometer can be a bit costlier, but they are not that costlier for an organization with essential workers. Know ways to sanitize a good local thermometer/ medical supplies (This is the new normal). Create a #MasksForAllInitiative for the rest of the year (A good leaders will always promote this). 

>* Enough medicine for storage/ backup in a medical centre, which are far away from cities/ accessible towns.

>* Being Vigilant about the number of cases also makes people cognizant of taking appropriate steps in a given location.
(The Aaorogya Setu App does it best, gives several cases in 500m/ 1k.m. and more)

>* A repetitive message of a good number of ads on television about safety measures + Healthy living would be great to increase awareness. This can be the default television channel 0000 (This is the same channel we get most of the ads from the subscriber). 

>* There are cities with the second wave of the virus. [In News - Second Waves Are Plaguing Asia’s Virus Recovery](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-14/asia-s-virus-taming-stars-disappointed-by-resurgence-of-casesl)

>* Cities with most cases should be given special attention. A root cause should be found to prevent the second wave in such locations.

UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction,](https://twitter.com/UNDRR), [3. India Met. Dept. - India](https://twitter.com/Indiametdept), [4. ESA EarthObservation - Europe](https://twitter.com/ESA_EO), [5. NOAA Climate.gov](https://twitter.com/NOAAClimate)

>* In a situation like mass evacuation when one has to get evacuated in an abrupt situation. Periodic (say in 3 days) self assess can be of good use. This is one of the features in Aarogya Setu App/ But, I believe other apps in the other countries may have the same feature. This is one centralized way for government knowing the infection rate. (Special Guidelines)

>* When a cyclone hits there is a disruption in power supply and telecom connection. one can save the data of self-access and upload it later. Or the second solution is to use mesh network as proposed in Call for code for uploading data. [Project Owl - 2018 IBM Call for code](https://www.project-owl.com/). The mesh network helps first responders to be on-site and get better reception and connection to help people. 

20. Food, clothing, shelter and healthcare should be basic rights and not a privilege.

21. Fuzzy tailgating - As the number of police to patrol and doctors to treat COVID 19 patients being constant. There is anyway going to be many more violations knowingly and unknowingly. This is from PAWS security project of Dr Milind Tambe. The situation is when the people tend to violate a lockdown a drone system/ or a camera overhead the traffic indicator (This is there to check traffic violation in many cities across various) will inform them about the lockdown and humbly request them to follow the procedure. With section 144 going around i.e. night curfew from 7 pm to 7 am for India, not sure about others. This will significantly help the general population, police and doctors. A similar new where a robot reminds prk-goers of social distancing in singapore [link](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/10/watch-robot-dog-reminds-park-goers-social-distancing-singapore/)

Random thought:- During one of the world war, people used the siren to stay indoors and to keep them safe. This siren can be an indication of symbolic representation of COVID lockdown announcement, and help people to get back to their houses safely before curfew.

22. It has been found that most affected people are the one in metropolitan cities(India- Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai US - New York), deployment of large forces and knowing the infrastructure + lifestyle can be a plus in situation like this. I was looking at the case of Taiwan what made them kick covid19 faster in spite of being in China. Here is look inside Taiwan's lifestyle from [BBC-Click](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvGmhvqrTWU) {Diclaimer:- I used to watch click when I was a kid, for Infrastructure, you can check Natgeo - mega-structures.}

23. Covid19 in wastewater - (AI + submersible solution) As most wastewater meets the sea or location where they get treated before they are sent to the sea. One peculiar in New is:- At least 440 people were likely infected with COVID-19 in the area around the treatment facility in Massachusetts — much higher than reported cases [link-](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/water/covid-19-new-research-examines-wastewater-to-detect-community-spread-70489) [April 16, 2020] A startup company called [Biobot](https://www.biobot.io/) is working on this problem.(In technex (IIT(BHU) technical fest) we used to have a problem statement called yellow submarine, where a submarine has complete a task from location A to B.)

24. The locations for drone medical supply usage will be the same off-road ballot centres.

25. Emotional companion robots would become a new thing in the Post-COVID era. This one is derived from emotional pets, which people carry around in flights. For e.g. [Vector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy2Z2TWAt6A) A lower version of called Cozmo was also there in the AAAI-20 Student Outreach Workshop [link](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/AAAI20-Outreach/)
(I believe number 25 is like living in the year 2050)
